            <h3>What is sport?</h3>
            <p>An activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.</p>
            <p>It is well known that prevention is better than cure. Physical exercise is related this better aspect. It can prevent many diseases, ailments and problems. Curing of discuses needs medicine and even surgical operation. They involve a lot of money. But more alarming is that they can cause side effect and may create newer problem or diseases. In this respect, physical exercise is a better option too. Some people go the doctors to reduce their fat from the belly. They take medicine but in most of the cases, they suffer a lot from stomach disorder and other abdominal problems. Moreover, it cannot remove or reduce fat from the tissues of other parts of the body. So the risk of heart ailment remains the name. on the other hand, physical exercise and reduce or remove fat from all parts of the body, reduce the bulky abdomen, remove cholesterol from the blood and reduce the risk of a heart attack. It is my personal experience that physical exercise involves both body and mind.

            <h3>What is a gym?</h3>
            <p>A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics. The word is derived from the ancient Greek gymnasium.</p>
            <p>Physical activity is an important determinant of health. Its fundamental role in energy balance and weight control and in decreasing the risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, and depression is widely known. But in this fast paced life, people hardly incorporate physical activity in their daily routine. Non communicable diseases have, as a result been on the rise across the world.

                Even Mauritius have not been spared from this growing concern on diseases. Undeniably, compared to the past, the health of Mauritians has bettered given that now more facilities are available to combat once mortal diseases. Lifespan has increased as a result and the trend is there are more people as from 65 years old with the balance tipping in favour of the female population. The main problem that Mauritius faces nowadays is in terms of non communicable diseases. The new life trend now leads to other complications like diabetes, hypertension, kidney failure, heart problems, smoke and alcohol related problems.</p>
